# core-rollback.sh - undo the automatic engine upgrade performed by
# scripts/sync-core.sh and restore the exact core the repository shipped
# before this build started.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (1.2.2)
# -----------------------
# The core auto-upgrade is a convenience. A convenience must never be able to
# break a release. Upstream can rename a type, add a field to a struct or add
# a parameter to a function at any time, and no amount of textual merging can
# guarantee that the result still compiles - that is exactly how core 1.4.0
# broke the first 1.2.2 build:
#
#   error[E0063]: missing fields `expected_pins` and `pin_endpoint`
#   error[E0061]: this function takes 8 arguments but 7 arguments were supplied
#
# So the CI "Build engine (Aether)" step is allowed to fail ONCE: it calls this
# script, which puts the previously vendored core back, and then builds again.
# The release still ships - just with the engine the repo already had - and the
# run is annotated so the upgrade can be finished by hand.
#
# Everything sync-core.sh wrote is reverted: the sources, CORE_VERSION, the
# baseline cache and the changelog lines in both READMEs.
